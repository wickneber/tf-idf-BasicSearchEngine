# tf-idf-BasicSearchEngine
This is the final project to my search engines class at UCI. I implemented a search engine using python 3 that would rank webpages 
based on the tf-idf algorithm and would search and return the most relevant webpages based on a query. This was all under the constraint that I could not exceed the allocation of 250 MB of ram and needed to search a set of websites (The UCI ICS websites) which is about 50,000 individual pages in sub second time. This code is a little messy but its the best I could do with the time constraints I had :). I hope anyone reading this and is interested in search engines can glean some insight on how they work.
